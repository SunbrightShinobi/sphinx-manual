# The syntax of this file is yaml, it should be a list of lists (2 levels)
# A line in the release history will look like this:
# - - RevLevel (NC, A, B, C, ...), leave blank
#   - Technical Reason, any string will do
#   - The section (or sections) that were updated as part of this fix leave blank for blank
#   - The date of release, leave blank for additional reasons
#
# If you want to span multiple lines, you need to use the ">" folding structure for yaml with the chomping indicator
# Eg, ">4" means that there are multiple lines following and that yaml should only remove the first 4 spaces.  When this is used, the
# spacing must be exact on the following lines.  See the example for Rev A below.
#
# For example:
# - - NC
#   - Initial Release
#   - All
#   - 2016-01-02
# - - A
#   - >4
