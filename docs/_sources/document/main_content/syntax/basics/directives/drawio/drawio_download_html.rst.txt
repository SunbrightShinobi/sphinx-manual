.. important::

  Currently the embedding of the html files does work for some reason (if, it slightly misplaces a few items in positions where as opening the same html file via ``:download:`filename.html``` looks clean. So the recommendation is to use that method. So the render section below was placed into a code-block for now.

You can also embed an DrawIO file that is saved as an editable HTML file with ``.. raw:: html`` but this only works in html builds. You can then just edit this html file in DrawIO like a drawio file or editable SVG file.

.. only:: html

    :download:`Right-Click, Open link in new tab (drawio_example.html) <drawio_example.html>`
